Creation of two plots of the Magnon_ComponentA3Scan.nxs converted data. Firstly, a polar plot is created on a reciprocal lattice axes, with adaptive bins and non-logarithmic intensities.

Plotting of intensities measured between ~1.29 meV and ~1.34 meV using adaptive polar binning.

   :width: 45% 

Plotting of intensities measured between ~1.29 meV and ~1.34 meV using equi-sized rectangular binning. As the binning is chosen too fine a lot of holes appear in the plot.
