05/12-18 - LSCO II 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Continuation of elastic measurements on LSCO. Changed :math:`E_i` to 4.05 meV incoming to move Bragg peak to higher :math:`A4` values to avoid the excess background from the direct beam hitting the side of the tank opening. Further, a Boral plate was mounted.
