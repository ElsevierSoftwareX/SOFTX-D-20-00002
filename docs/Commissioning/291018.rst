29/10-18 - Start of hot commissioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Monday 29th of October.
Today, the following is planned:

- First neutrons on the instrument
- Initial check of old alignment of A1-A2

Possible difficulties to be discussed:

- Tuning of the bias voltage of the detectors can be difficult as there is non-linearities in measurements.
    - On RITA2 this was countered by putting a mask in front of the 2D detector.
    - The CAMEA back-end has a build-in mask due to the cross-talk shielding and the scattering of analysers into different parts of the detectors.
    - It could be possible to assume that the design energies of the back-end are true making it possible to figure out :math:`E_i` independent of the A4 angle.
    - The energies expected is provided in table 
- Alignment of the A2 and A4 are not independen but need to be aligned together
